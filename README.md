# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
We have been tasked to determine credit card risk, in general credit risk inherently has unbalanced classification. so we will have to administer a series of tests to properly determine risk. using techniques such as machine learning and algorithms to predict credit risk to a higher certainty. we will be using the following to determine the best possible test and technique to give us the most accurate results.

* Oversampling the data using RandomOverSampler & SMOTE

* Undersampling the dats using ClusterCentroids

* using a combination of under and over sampling using SMOTEEN

* finally compare BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier Machine Learning in hopes of reducing the bias to help predict the risk

## Results
